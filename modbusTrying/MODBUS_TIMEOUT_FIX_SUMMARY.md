# Modbus Timeout Fix Summary

## Problem

After getting standalone mode working, ModbusPoll desktop application experiences timeout errors after some number of calls.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Race Conditions**: Missing critical sections in Modbus library
2. **Buffer Management**: DMA buffer reused without proper state management
3. **Incomplete Error Recovery**: UART errors not properly clearing Modbus state
4. **No Timeout Detection**: No mechanism to detect and recover from stuck states

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enabled Critical Sections

**File**: `modbus_conf.h`

```c
// Changed from 0 to 1
#define STMODBUS_USE_CRITICAL_SECTIONS 1

// Added critical section macros for bare-metal
#define stmbEnterCriticalSection __disable_irq()
#define stmbLeaveCriticalSection __enable_irq()
```

### 2. Enhanced Buffer State Management

**File**: `uart_callbacks.c`

- Added `uart_busy` flag to prevent concurrent processing
- Added buffer size validation to prevent overflow
- Added processing delays to ensure completion
- Reset busy flag before restarting DMA

### 3. Improved Error Recovery

**File**: `uart_callbacks.c`

- Clear busy flag on all error conditions
- Clear all UART error flags (ORE, NE, FE, PE, IDLE)
- Added delay to allow error state to stabilize
- Reset Modbus context validation

### 4. Added Timeout Monitoring

**File**: `uart_callbacks.c` & `uart_callbacks.h`

- New function: `UART_Callbacks_ProcessTimeout()`
- Monitors `uart_busy` state with counter
- Force recovery if stuck for >100ms
- Aborts and restarts UART DMA on timeout

**File**: `main.c`

- Added timeout processing to main loop
- Calls `UART_Callbacks_ProcessTimeout()` every 100ms

### 5. Enhanced Callback Robustness

**Files**: Multiple

- Better parameter validation
- Proper state reset sequences
- More comprehensive error flag clearing
- Improved interrupt synchronization

## Build Status

- **✅ Build Successful**: 19,876 bytes text + 52 bytes data = 23,948 bytes total
- **✅ Critical Sections**: Enabled with interrupt disable/enable
- **✅ Timeout Recovery**: Active monitoring and recovery mechanism
- **✅ Error Handling**: Comprehensive UART error recovery

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Flash Updated Firmware

Flash the new `modbusTrying.elf` to your STM32F303K8

### 2. Test Sustained Operations

Use ModbusPoll to perform:

- Continuous polling of holding registers (40001-40020)
- High frequency requests (100ms intervals)
- Extended test runs (10+ minutes)
- Mixed read/write operations

### 3. Monitor Behavior

- **PA6 LED**: Should continue blinking at 1Hz (indicates main loop running)
- **No Timeouts**: ModbusPoll should not show timeout errors
- **Consistent Response**: Register values should be read reliably

### 4. Stress Testing

- Try burst requests
- Test with different polling rates
- Monitor for memory leaks or state corruption

## Expected Results

- **Eliminated Timeouts**: No more timeout errors in ModbusPoll
- **Robust Recovery**: Automatic recovery from communication errors
- **Stable Operation**: Sustained operation without degradation
- **Real-time Response**: Consistent response times under load

## Key Improvements

1. **Thread Safety**: Critical sections prevent race conditions
2. **State Management**: Proper buffer and UART state tracking
3. **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
4. **Timeout Protection**: Automatic detection and recovery from stuck states
5. **Stability**: Enhanced robustness for sustained operations

The timeout fixes address the core communication reliability issues while maintaining the working standalone mode functionality.

## Important Note: Standalone Mode Discovery

**Power Reset Alternative**: During development, it was discovered that **resetting device power after uploading firmware** also resolves standalone mode issues, independent of the syscalls.c fixes.

**For Testing**: If experiencing standalone mode issues:

1. Upload firmware
2. **Disconnect and reconnect USB power** (or press reset button)
3. Test operation

This provides an immediate workaround while the more robust syscalls.c fixes ensure long-term reliability without requiring manual power cycles.
